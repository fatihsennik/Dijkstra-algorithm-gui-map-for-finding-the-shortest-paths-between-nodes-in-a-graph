# Dijkstra algorithm in action

## How Does Dijkstra's algorithm work ?
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1958 and published three years later. The algorithm exists in many variants; Dijkstra's original variant found the shortest path between two nodes, but a more common variant fixes a single node as the "source" node and finds shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest-path tree.

# How to Use it ?
Click to add nodes and then right click a node and then again right click on another node to link them eachother. You can freely reposition them by dragging nodes according to background map image. In order to create Background map image you can use open streetmap: [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)  As for the Fun part, select starting node and then select end node and click to start to get shortest path between selected nodes thanks to Dijkstra's algorithm.
